            I received my B.S in computer science from the Univeristy of Washington. During summer internships, I built tools
            to improve data workflows and developed full stack applications, gaining professional experience and learning
            how to create practical solutions with efficiency and usability.

            Lately, I've been exploring and working on projects using AI and LLMs to create tools that tackle
            everyday challenges in fun and innovative ways.
            In my free time, I enjoy running, watching procedural crime series, traveling and skydiving!
